UPGRADECENTER_COMP_LIB_2_DESC=SuccessFactors $(Competency) 2.0 $(Library) Description
UPGRADECENTER_COMP_LIB_2_DESC_KEY=$(Competency) 2.0 $(Library) Description
UPGRADECENTER_COMP_LIB_2_FEATURE_INTRO=The most recent version of the SuccessFactors Competency library (2.0) is the result of a 4-year development project led by a team of industrial-organizational psychologists from SuccessFactors working in partnership with a variety of SuccessFactors customers, leveraging recent research looking at the structure of job performance. <br /> <br />The new library contains 86 competencies, grouped into 10 categories. As with the original SuccessFactors competency library, extensive writing assistant and coaching advisor content is integrated into the library. This content has been expanded and standardized to include 18 ?teasers? and 12 coaching tips per competency. <br /> <br />The competency library is behaviorally focused\: the competencies are defined using behaviors that are specific and observable. Care was taken to title competencies with terms that have clear meaning and define competency performance using specific types of productive and counterproductive behavior. <br /> <br />This version of the competency library no longer contains multiple versions of ?tone? statements in the writing assistant content; internal analysis showed that providing more consistent behavior definitions is a more powerful method for managers to select and personalize competency rating comments than offering multiple tone levels. <br /> <br />Enabling this upgrade will load the new competency library into your company instance. It will not overwrite your existing competency content. You have the option to customize the competency library content with the administration tools. You will also need to map the new competencies to any job roles you have defined, in order for them to automatically appear on review forms. <br /> <br /> You may continue to use the original competency library (though aspects of it have become outdated as the field of competency modeling has developed and matured). You may also continue to use any custom or 3rd-party competency content already loaded into your system.<br /> <br />

UPGRADECENTER_THRIVE_APP_INTRO=<p><b>Redefining the way businesses manage their most important asset\: their people</b></p> <p>SAP SuccessFactors, Qualtrics and Thrive Global have partnered together to create the Thrive XM Index, a groundbreaking tool to measure how people experience directly connects to business performance. Culture, well-being, engagement and trust are just a few of the themes that have dominated the workforce and people discussion over the last year. But overwhelmingly, companies ? including many fast-growth companies with reputations as disruptors ? have neglected something far more important\: experiences. These companies tend to focus on finding gaps in the consumer experience and filling them. But when it comes to their own people, they have an experience gap.</p> <br/> <p>The Thrive XM Index creates a framework that gives companies a different way to gather insights about their own employee populations. It brings together an organization?s X-data (employee-reported people experience information) and O-data (HR-reported performance insights) and then explores their impact on business performance. We are offering the Thrive XM Index free to all SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central customers.</p> <br/> <p>We encourage Employee Central customers to enable this tile through the Upgrade Center and add it to your home page to learn more about the Thrive XM Index and to stay up-to-date on the insights and recommendations coming from this game-changing initiative.</p>
